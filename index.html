                    <p>As the Director of Computer Science and AI at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF), I
                        lead efforts to close the opportunity gap in STEM education, ensuring that all
                        students—particularly those from underserved communities—have access to the skills and knowledge
                        needed for the tech-driven future.</p>
                    <p>With over 17 years of experience as an educator, curriculum designer, and robotics mentor, I am
                        passionate about integrating AI and computer science into scalable, hands-on programs that
                        prepare students for leadership in tomorrow's world. My journey began on a FIRST Robotics team
                        in South Central LA, which ignited my love for technology and shaped my belief in the
                        transformative power of STEM education.</p>
                    <p>Today, I focus on creating innovative curricula that blend cutting-edge AI, coding, and robotics
                        with critical thinking and ethical practices. Through my work at SVEF, I collaborate with school
                        districts, educators, and industry leaders to build programs that empower students to thrive in
                        emerging technologies.</p>
