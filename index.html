                    <p class="lead">I’m Jose Quijas Castro. A leader in AI-driven education and program design.</p>
                    <p>With over 17 years in STEM education and technology, I specialize in developing systems that
                        empower educators and provide personalized learning experiences for students. I currently lead
                        AI initiatives at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation, where I focus on creating scalable,
                        equitable educational tools.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">What drives me</h3>
                    <p>I believe in using AI to make education more accessible, efficient, and effective. By building
                        tools that support both teachers and students, I aim to foster a future where every student,
                        regardless of background, has the resources to succeed.</p>

                            in STEM.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Jose's approach to AI in education is built on three core principles:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Human-Centered AI:</strong> Technology should serve real human needs, focusing
                                on measurable impact for both teachers and students rather than technology for its own
                                sake</li>
                            <li><strong>Equity and Access:</strong> AI tools must be designed to reduce, not amplify,
                                educational inequities, ensuring all students benefit regardless of background or
                                resources</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalable Automation:</strong> Building systems that reduce administrative burden
                                on educators while maintaining the human elements that make education effective</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This approach ensures that AI enhances rather than replaces the crucial human elements of
                            teaching and learning.</p>
